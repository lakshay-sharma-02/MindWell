    question: "What should I expect in my first session?",
    answer: "Your first session is a chance for us to get to know each other. We'll discuss what brings you to therapy, your goals, and any questions you have. It's a collaborative conversation to ensure we're the right fit and to start building a foundation for our work together.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long are therapy sessions?",
    answer: "Individual therapy sessions are typically 50 minutes. Initial consultations may run slightly longer (60-75 minutes) to allow time for a comprehensive assessment and to answer all your questions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer virtual sessions?",

  {
    question: "Is everything I share confidential?",
    answer: "Yes, confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy. What you share stays between us, with very limited exceptions required by law (imminent danger to self or others, child/elder abuse, or court orders). We'll discuss this in detail during your first session.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to cancel an appointment?",
    answer: "Life happens! I request 24 hours notice for cancellations to avoid a late cancellation fee. This allows me to offer the time slot to clients on my waiting list.",

    question: "How do I know if therapy is working?",
    answer: "We'll regularly check in on your progress toward your goals. You might notice changes in how you think, feel, or respond to situations. Many clients report feeling more hopeful, having better relationships, and experiencing fewer symptoms within the first few months.",
